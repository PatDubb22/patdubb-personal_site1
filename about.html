            <p>My name is Philip Walton. I'm an engineer at Google on the developer relations team and formerly, senior front-end software engineer at Appfolio. I've been working on the web professionally since 2006, and unprofessionally since 1998 when I made my first website.<br>
            <br>This blog is a place wherer I can explore the ideals I think about outside of work. I tend to perfer writing about larger, more abstract topics, but occasionally I'll bring up a specific technology as well. <br><br> if you're interested in my thoughts on something, let me know, and maybe it'll turn into my next article.<br><br>

            <p>Eventually, you will go through and add your own content. But sometimes it's helpful to have a bunch because if we don't have enough information on the page, it's hard to see how the actual styles look.<br><br><strong>It does not matter what the website looks like at a larger width.</strong>This is the attitude that drives mobile</p>
